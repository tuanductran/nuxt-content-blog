## Linked IP (Setup on my iPhone)

If you are unable to set up NextDNS using our apps, DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS or IPv6, then use the DNS servers below and link your IP. This is mostly for use on home networks and not recommended on mobile.

üí° By employing this method, your network IP will be automatically updated on NextDNS each time you restart your home network device.

- **Show advanced options**

  You can also programmatically update your linked IP by calling.

  1. Navigate to Settings > Wi-Fi to reach the proxy configuration on your iPhone.
  2. Select the name of the Wi-Fi network you're currently connected to.
  3. Scroll down, and you'll find the "Configure Proxy" option at the bottom of the display.
  4. Choose "Auto" and enter an address formatted like this: https://link-ip.nextdns.io/xxxxxx/9541288ae9febb35.

## Setup Guide

Follow the instructions below to set up NextDNS on your device, browser or router.

### NextDNS for Routers (This is my current setup)

Only works on routers that can run executables.

Head over to our open-source repository at [https://github.com/nextdns/nextdns/wiki](https://github.com/nextdns/nextdns/wiki) for installation instructions.

### IPv6

1. Open the preferences for your router. Usually you can access it from your browser via a URL (like [http://192.168.0.1/](http://192.168.0.1/) or [http://192.168.1.1/](http://192.168.1.1/)).
2. Locate the DNS settings inside the interface.
3. Remove all addresses (if any) then add **2a07:a8c0::xx:xxxx** and **2a07:a8c1::xx:xxxx**.
4. Click Save (or similar).

‚ö†Ô∏è Some routers may not support the IPv6 notation above. In that case, use **2a07:a8c0:0000:0000:0000:0000:00xx:xxxx** and **2a07:a8c1:0000:0000:0000:0000:00xx:xxxx**.

### IPv4 (with Linked IP)

1. Open the preferences for your router. Usually you can access it from your browser via a URL (like [http://192.168.0.1/](http://192.168.0.1/) or [http://192.168.1.1/](http://192.168.1.1/)).
2. Locate the DNS settings inside the interface.
3. Remove all addresses (if any) then add **45.90.28.14** and **45.90.30.14**.
4. Click Save (or similar).

## Security

Protect yourself against malware and phishing attacks, cryptojacking and more.

Determine your threat model and fine-tune your security strategy by enabling 10+ different types of protections.

Use the most trusted threat intelligence feeds containing millions of malicious domains ‚Äî all updated in real-time.

Go beyond the domain ‚Äî we analyze DNS questions and answers on-the-fly (in a matter of nanoseconds) in order to detect and block malicious behavior.

With usually only a few hours between domain registration and the start of an attack, our threat intelligence system is built to catch malicious domains earlier than classic security solutions.

### Threat Intelligence Feeds

Block domains known to distribute malware, launch phishing attacks and host command-and-control servers using a blend of the most reputable threat intelligence feeds ‚Äî all updated in real-time.

- [ ] Use Threat Intelligence Feeds

### AI-Driven Threat Detection (Beta)

Block millions of threats detected by our AI technology ‚Äî a proprietary AI engine designed from the ground up for DNS with hundreds of signals, terabytes of training data and real-time decision making.

- [x] Enable AI-Driven Threat Detection

### Google Safe Browsing

Block malware and phishing domains using Google Safe Browsing ‚Äî a technology that examines billions of URLs per day looking for unsafe websites. Unlike the version embedded in some browsers, this does not associate your public IP address to threats and does not allow bypassing the block.

- [x] Enable Google Safe Browsing

### Cryptojacking Protection

Prevent the unauthorized use of your devices to mine cryptocurrency.

- [x] Enable Cryptojacking Protection

### DNS Rebinding Protection

Prevent attackers from taking control of your local devices through the Internet by automatically blocking DNS responses containing private IP addresses.

- [x] Enable DNS Rebinding Protection

### IDN Homograph Attacks Protection

Block domains that impersonate other domains by abusing the large character set made available with the arrival of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) ‚Äî e.g. replacing the Latin letter "e" with the Cyrillic letter "–µ".

- [x] Enable Homograph Attacks Protection

### Typosquatting Protection

Block domains registered by malicious actors that target users who incorrectly type a website address into their browser ‚Äî e.g. [gooogle.com](http://gooogle.com/) instead of [google.com](http://google.com/).

- [x] Enable Typosquatting Protection

### Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) Protection

Block domains generated by Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) seen in various families of malware that can be used as rendezvous points with their command and control servers.

- [x] Enable DGA Protection

### Block Newly Registered Domains (NRDs)

Block domains registered less than 30 days ago. Those domains are known to be favored by threat actors to launch malicious campaigns.

- [x] Block Newly Registered Domains (NRDs)

### Block Dynamic DNS Hostnames

Dynamic DNS (or DDNS) services let malicious actors quickly set up hostnames for free and without any validation or identity verification. While legit DDNS hostnames are rarely accessed in every-day use, their malicious counterparts are heavily used in phishing campaigns ‚Äî e.g. paypal‚Äëlogin.duckdns.org.

If you are using DDNS, note that this setting will not block the DDNS services' own website or their update API.

- [x] Enable Block Dynamic DNS Hostnames

### Block Parked Domains

Parked domains are single-page websites often laden with ads and devoid of any value. Parked domain monetization can sometimes get mixed up with suspicious practices and malicious content.

- [x] Block Parked Domains

### Block Top-Level Domains (TLDs)

Block all domains and subdomains belonging to specific TLDs.

1. .work
2. .fit
3. .surf
4. .review
5. .asia
6. .tokyo
7. .cn
8. .monster
9. .info
10. .Êú∫ÊûÑ

### Block Page

Display a block page when a domain is being blocked. This may slightly increase page load time and an HTTPS warning may appear in some cases. When disabled, blocked queries will be answered with the unspecified address (0.0.0.0 or ::).

**NextDNS Root CA**: Remove the HTTPS warning when loading the block page by installing and trusting our root CA at [https://nextdns.io/ca](https://nextdns.io/ca). Read instructions on how to do this [here](https://help.nextdns.io/t/g9hmv0a/how-to-install-and-trust-nextdns-root-ca).

**CNAME Flattening**

Prevent CNAME-chasing resolvers from making unnecessary queries and pollute the logs with intermediate domains.

- [x] Enable CNAME Flattening

## Web3 (Beta)

Web3 refers to a decentralized and censorship-resistant online ecosystem comprised of innovative technologies such as blockchain-based domain registries (e.g. Ethereum Name Service) and distributed content storage and delivery networks (e.g. IPFS). When enabled, NextDNS will act as an unfiltered gateway to this new Web, letting you experience it firsthand without the need to install anything.

As most browsers only support classic top-level domains at the moment, you should add a trailing slash ("/") when trying to access a Web3 domain directly (e.g. "vitalik.eth/" instead of "vitalik.eth").

- [x] Enable Web3
